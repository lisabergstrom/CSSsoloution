           <!-- Explanation of CSS -->
        <h2> Solution for Technigo Coding Challenge</h2>
        <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language for describing the presentation of
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_page">Web pages</a> 
        , including colours, layout, and fonts, thus making our web pages presentable to the users.
        CSS is designed to make style sheets for the web. It is independent of 
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML">HTML</a>
        and can be used with any
    <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/XML/XML_introduction">XML</a>
        -based markup language. Now letâ€™s try to break the acronym:</p>  
        <p>* Cascading = Falling of Styles</p> 
        <p>* Style = Adding designs/Styling our HTML tags</p>
        <p>* Sheets = Writing our style in different documents</p>
        <p>What are the capabilities of CSS? CSS helps in defining text alignment, color, font, size, spacing, borders, layout, and many such typographic characteristics. It can do all of it independently for on-screen as well as printed views.</p>
        <p>Is CSS difficult to learn? CSS is not difficult to learn but since it is detailed, it can be confusing. Learning the basics of CSS does not take time at all. However, if you want to master CSS, it may take some time for you.</p>
